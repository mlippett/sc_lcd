The LCD module is designed to drive Graphics LCD panel of resolution upto VGA.
The component can support various LCD panels available in the market (LCD modules with no inbuilt memory).
The module supports various targets - each available as a sub-folder within the source folder
The lcd_defines.h file (specific for each target) is available under each target sub-folder 
and will be included based on the target selected
The target selection can be done using the MakeFile option in the application

Example:

If the required target is TM04NDH02 panel, in the makefile set the option LCD_TARGET for the panel name
LCD_TARGET    = AT043TN24
In the INCLUDES, add the sub-folder with the target name (i.e)
INCLUDES = ../module_lcd/src/$(LCD_TARGET)
This will include the "lcd_defines.h" required for the selected targert

The application should also include the port mapping for the LCD as per the hardware used.
A variable of the type structure "lcd_ports" is created and contains the port information

Example:
In the demo.xc

on stdcore[0]: lcd_ports lcd_ports_init = {
		XS1_PORT_1O,
		XS1_PORT_4F,
		XS1_PORT_32A,
		XS1_CLKBLK_3 };
		
The declared variable lcd_ports_init is used in the LCD thread call as
lcd_server(c_lcd, lcd_ports_init);
